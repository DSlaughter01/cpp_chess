A chess engine using SDL2 and C++, using bitboards. 
Currently contains the logic to initialise Game and GUI objects, take user input in the form of clicks, and move pieces around the board under conditions on the user's clicks.
A work in progress which lacks any rules on how the pieces can move, as well as an end to the game, putting the king in check, etc.
